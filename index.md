Tyrion Lannister, also known by the nickname the Halfman or the Imp and later by the alias Hugor Hill, is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. He is a prominent point of view character in the series, having the most viewpoint chapters (49 chapters) in the first five published novels. Based on an idea that came to Martin while writing the 1981 novel Windhaven,[2] Tyrion has been called one of the author's finest creations and most popular characters by The New York Times.[3][4] Martin has named the character as his favorite in the series.[2][5]
Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996) and subsequently in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000), Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but returned in A Dance with Dragons (2011), and is confirmed to appear in the forthcoming sixth novel The Winds of Winter.[6][7] The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish in 2013 The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels
